Kurzgesagt life calendar generator
====================================

This is a fork of
[Erik Nyquist](https://github.com/eriknyquist)'s  [Personalised Life Calendar Generator](https://store.waitbutwhy.com/collections/life-calendars).

I modified it to imitate Kurzgesagt's "Calendar of Your Life" since it seemed quite expensive even without shipping.

Currently it generates what I found to be the bare minimum in resemblance to the original and coding quality, and doesn't allow for any customization unlike Erik's version (although I've yet to remove a lot of the code).

For instructions on how to run this please read the [README](https://github.com/eriknyquist/generate_life_calendar/blob/master/README.rst) of the original version. If you have windows and have an "out of memory" error while running, check the [issues](https://github.com/eriknyquist/generate_life_calendar/issues) page.
